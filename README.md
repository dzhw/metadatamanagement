# Developing the MDM system

Please checkout the development branch before starting to code and create a new branch starting with your username followed by the backlog items issue number you will be working on:

    git checkout development
    git checkout -b rreitmann/issue1234

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. Java: You need to install java 8 sdk on your system. On Ubuntu you should use [SDKMAN!][]
2. Maven: You need to install maven 3 on your system. On Ubuntu you should use [SDKMAN!][]
3. [Node.js][]: Node.js (latest) and npm (coming with node.js) are required as well. On Ubuntu you should install node using [NVM][]

We use [Grunt][] as our client build system. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

You need to install [Bower][] globally as well:

    npm install -g bower

## Running on your local machine

Before starting the app on your local machine you need to start the following Document Stores:
1. Mongodb: Mongodb must be running on the default port, on ubuntu you should install it from here https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
2. Elasticsearch (5.2.2): Elasticsearch must be running on its default port. You can download it from here https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    mvn
    grunt

## Building for the dev environment

To optimize the metadatamanagement client for the dev environment, run:

    mvn -Pdev clean install

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files using grunt. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

Before deploying the dev system you need to [install the cloudfoundry cli](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html#-linux-installation).

You can build and deploy the jar to the dev environment by running

    ./deploy/build-and-deploy.sh dev

## Pivotal Cloudfoundry
This project is currently built and deployed to Pivotal Cloudfoundry by [Travis CI][TravisCI]. You can test the latest version on https://metadatamanagement-dev.cfapps.io/
